                    <p>COVID-19 is not a foodborne illness according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html">CDC’s frequently asked questions. </a>While it may be possible to become infected if an object that has the virus on it comes in contact with a person's mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Additionally, before preparing or eating food, it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. </p>

                    <p>In order to comply with state and local regulations, some restaurants have had to adjust their operating hours.

                    <p>The wearing of gloves and masks/face coverings by employees who are interacting with customers is now standard in all McDonald's U.S. restaurants.                    </p>

                    <p>While more than 99% of our restaurants are open, we continue to act in line with local regulations, which unfortunately does mean that restaurants in select locations may be operating on limited hours or may be closed temporarily in an effort to protect the health of our people and you, our customers.

                    <p>We are closely monitoring all local, state and federal regulations to provide customers with a contactless pickup experience. As a result of these regulations, some restaurants are only serving customers through the Drive-Thru, while others remain open for carry-out, as well as serving customers through the Drive-Thru, with Mobile Order and Pay on McDonald's Global Mobile App and with McDelivery®.</p>
